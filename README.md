# Career Portfolio

Your career portfolio contains all of the reviews, promotions, and celebrations that make up the narrative of your career.

There's no "right way" to use your career portfolio, however below are some suggestions to get you started.

You may use your career portfolio as:

- A place for reflection on your career growth
- A tool for collaborating with your manager on your next review or promotion
- A place to archive wins and compliments to refer to later
- A tool to solicit feedback from your manager early and often

Ultimately, this is your space — you can feel empowered to change the file structure, issue templates, actions, and collaborators in whatever way helps you reflect and grow best!
